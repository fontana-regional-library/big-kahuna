=== Big Kahuna Importing ===

The import functions process imports for Evergreen and Overdrive catalogs, and a framework for getting additional
information about collection items that are imported.

== Description ==

Uses WP All Import to trigger base record retrieval.

== Setup ==
1. Setup/import ACF Fields
2. Configure taxonomy importers
2. Import Shelf and Keyword Taxonomies
3. Configure Fontana Settings
4. Configure Importers

== ACF FIELDS ==
ACF Fields have been added to facilitate processing. "acf-FIELDS-TEMPLATE-export-2018-12-20.json" is located in the
docs folder. Includes some rearranging, additions of collection item ACF fields, Term fields for new shelf and keyword taxonomies, and
shelf_location_id field for shelf taxonomy.

== Shelf and Keywords Taxonomies ==
Two additional taxonomies are created to provide a more dynamic way of retrieving holdings information and processing items for 
tagging/classfication.

* Shelf - fixed list (taken from Evergreen Catalog), also includes overdrive library ids. The docs/term-lists folder includes
shelf.json to import via WP ALL import, as well as IMPORT_TEMPLATE_shelf.txt to assist with importing shelf terms.
* Keywords - Parent terms are used to organize by purpose/function. Parent terms should be imported first usng the
keyword-import1.csv file in docs/term-lists (Includes terms and descriptions). There is a list of child terms (keyword-import2.json)
and a WP All Import Template (IMPORT_TEMPLATE_child-keywords.txt) in the term-lists folder.

== Fontana Settings ==
Settings page added to store API keys, Overdrive Library Ids and collection import ids (not in use).
1. Configure API settings.
2. Add Overdrive Library name and ID (if API settings are configured, the other information about the overdrive library will be
retrieved).
3. Failed records check can be triggered from settings page (if item record retrieval has failed.)
4. Check Evergreen query queries the oldest evergreen records (older than 30 days) to check that items are still in holdings.
5. Update Cached term list will update the option that stores term/taxonomy info for item classification.

== Importers ==
Currently, 3 importers need to be setup. 
1. Evergreen (Import Template is in the docs folder): Importing new items(FONTANA is the institution name, 1 is the result page, 200 is number of items): 
http://nccardinal.org/opac/extras/browse/mods3/item-age/FONTANA/1/200
2. E-iNC Library import (Import Template is in the docs folder)
3. NC Kids Library import (Import Template is in the docs folder)

Overdrive libraries are imported via function entered into the url field: "[overdrive_library_download(IDNUMBER)]"
The import should be scheduled via cron to run (20,000+ records total / imports 250 records each time ~ 84 cycles for complete import).
An option is stored to keep track of progress/place in the import cycle.
After a full import has completed, a trigger will check items that haven't been updated since the last update and check the meta record
to see if the item is still available to the library. If the item is not currently owned, the title is flagged and trashed.
Another full import/check should take place in 1 week.
